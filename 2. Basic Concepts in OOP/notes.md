#Basic Concept In Programming


##Abstract
1. a class that inherits from a class is a `Child class`. and the `abstract class` (or any other class from which another class has inheritance) is the parent class


##Interface
1. `Interface` is the outline of the class
2. To implement an interface, use the ``implenets`` statement instead of extedn as is done with `abstract` class
